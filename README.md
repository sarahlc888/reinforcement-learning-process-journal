# reinforcement-learning-process-journal
## Overview
This repository documents my work studying reinforcement learning, as part of Andover's CSC600 in winter 2020-2021.

I draw from Sutton and Barto's [*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf), David Silver's [UCL Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/), and Denny Britz's [repository](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) of accompanying exercises and implementations.
